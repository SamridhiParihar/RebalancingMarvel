we have two classes :
 package practice.example.Codility.Codility1;
  public class OrderItem {
        public String name;
        public String size;
        public String quantity;
        public OrderItem(String name, String size, String quantity) {
               this.name = name; this.size = size; this.quantity = quantity;
        }
  }
  package practice.example.Codility.Codility1;
  public class Pizza {
        public String name ;
        public int price_S;
        public int price_M;
        public int price_L;
        public Pizza(String name, int price_S, int price_M, int price_L) {
                this.name = name; this.price_S = price_S;
                this.price_M = price_M;
                 this.price_L = price_L;
                 }
  }
  public class Solution {
        public int solution (Pizza[] menu , OrderItem [] order ){
                return 0;
        }
  }
  so you have to frame a question for me don't give me solution or anything
  ..I have given you two given classes that is OrderItem and Pizza name
  filed in both is for pizza name size and quantitiy is the pizza size and quantity
  ...(sizes can be "Medium","Large","Small") and in pizza class price_S denotes price
  of small size and so on for others ....
  now the question is there are four types of discount available :
  you can apply anyone(atmost one) if applicable and also if not you just need
  to return the total price you are given with the solution function to complete and return the value in integer format :
